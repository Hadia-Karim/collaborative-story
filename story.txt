A Short Story

A curious cat named Momo lived atop a bustling bakery in Paris.
Every morning, she watched pigeons dance over the rooftops.
One day, a red balloon floated into her window.
Attached was a tiny note: "Help me find my way home."
Intrigued, Momo followed the string across the city.
She dodged bicycles, climbed lampposts, and crossed a riverboat.
The string led to a lonely boy sitting in the park.
He smiled when he saw her, tears shining in his eyes.
Momo curled into his lap, the balloon gently bobbing above.
And from that day, neither of them ever felt alone again.
